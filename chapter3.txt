Advanced tools - Chainalysis
 Chainalysis is a software that can be used to trace coins. 
 The goal is to trace bitcoins to a known address or payment processor (to send a subpoena to the 
payment processor company).
 To facilitate the analysis, Chainalysis classifies bitcoin addresses in clusters. For example, 829 408 
bitcoin addresses are linked with the Silkroad market place.
 Counterparties: can be used to see where the money was received or spent.
 Chanalysis can do OSINT on bitcoin address : the software scrapes the internet to see if it can be 
found online.
 Limitation: Chainalysis is limited to bitcoin analysis only. They don't plan to analyze other currencies 
for the moment.

Install Vera Crypt
• Use the EDD tool to scan the drive for encrypted containers


Encrypted Disk Detector (v2.2.2 released October 11, 2019) is a commandline tool that can quickly and non-intrusively check for encrypted volumes 
on a computer system during incident response

The decision can then be made to investigate further and determine 
whether a live acquisition needs to be made in order to secure and 
preserve the evidence that would otherwise be lost if the plug was pulled.
• Encrypted Disk Detector checks the local physical drives on a system for 
TrueCrypt, PGP®, or Bitlocker® encrypted volumes. If no disk encryption 
signatures are found in the MBR, EDD also displays the OEM ID and, where 
applicable, the Volume Label for partitions on that drive, checking for 
Bitlocker® volumes
